  <h1 class="display-1">Top-5 Crypto Currencies in the Word</h1>
  <h5>1.Bitcoin</h5>
  <p>Bitcoin (₿) is a decentralized digital currency, without a central bank or single administrator, that can be sent from user to user on the peer-to-peer bitcoin network without the need for intermediaries.Transactions are verified by network nodes through cryptography and recorded in a public distributed ledger called a blockchain. The cryptocurrency was invented in 2008 by an unknown person or group of people using the name Satoshi Nakamoto.The currency began use in 2009 when its implementation was released as open-source software.</p>
  <p>Bitcoins are created as a reward for a process known as mining. They can be exchanged for other currencies, products, and services. Bitcoin has been criticized for its use in illegal transactions, the large amount of electricity (and thus carbon footprint) used by mining, price volatility, and thefts from exchanges. Some investors and economists have characterized it as a speculative bubble at various times. Others have used it as an investment, although several regulatory agencies have issued investor alerts about bitcoin.In September 2021, El Salvador officially adopted Bitcoin as legal tender, becoming the first nation to do so</p>

<!--Etherium-->
<h5>2.Etherium</h5>
<p>Ethereum is a decentralized, open-source blockchain with smart contract functionality. Ether (ETH or Ξ) is the native cryptocurrency of the platform. Amongst cryptocurrencies, Ether is second only to Bitcoin in market capitalization.

Ethereum was conceived in 2013 by programmer Vitalik Buterin. Additional founders of Ethereum included Gavin Wood, Charles Hoskinson, Anthony Di Iorio and Joseph Lubin. In 2014, development work commenced and was crowdfunded, and the network went live on 30 July 2015. The platform allows anyone to deploy permanent and immutable decentralized applications onto it, with which users can interact. Decentralized finance (DeFi) applications provide a broad array of financial services without the need for typical financial intermediaries like brokerages, exchanges, or banks, such as allowing cryptocurrency users to borrow against their holdings or lend them out for interest. Ethereum also allows for the creation and exchange of NFTs, which are non-interchangeable tokens connected to digital works of art or other real-world items and sold as unique digital property. Additionally, many other cryptocurrencies operate as ERC-20 tokens on top of the Ethereum blockchain and have utilized the platform for initial coin offerings.</p>

<!--binance coin-->
<h5>3.Binance coin</h5>
<p>Binance coin initially ran on the Ethereum blockchain with ERC 20 standard but has since become the native coin of the Binance chain. It was launched during an initial coin offering (ICO) in July 2017 and has a strict maximum of 200 million BNB tokens. It offered 10%, or 20 million, BNB tokens to angel investors, 40%, or 80 million, tokens to the founding team, and the remaining 50%, or 100 million, to the various participants through the ICO process.


Almost half the funds raised during the ICO process were intended to be used for Binance branding and marketing, while around one-third were used to build the Binance platform and perform necessary upgrades to the Binance ecosystem.


BNB was initially based on the Ethereum network but is now the native currency of Binance's own blockchain, the Binance chain.</p>

<!--solana-->
<h5>4.solana</h5>
<p>Solana is a public blockchain platform. It achieves consensus using the proof of stake mechanism.Its internal cryptocurrency is SOL.

In 2021, Bloomberg journalist Joanna Ossinger described Solana as "a potential long-term rival for Ethereum", citing superior transaction speeds and lower associated costs.

On 14 September 2021, the Solana blockchain went offline after a surge of transactions caused the network to fork, and different validators had different views on the state of the network. The network was shortly brought back online on 15 September 2021. Solana can purportedly handle 50,000 transactions per second, which is faster than the Ethereum blockchain, but still less than the 400,000 transactions seen during the spike.

Like various other blockchains, Solana can run smart contracts.

On 16 December 2021, former First Lady of the United States Melania Trump announced plans to use the platform to launch a Non-fungible token (NFT).The Solana Foundation issued a press release to clarify that her choice of the platform was not officially "part of any Solana-led initiative."</p>
